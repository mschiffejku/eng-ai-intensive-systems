# Supermarket Shelf Scanner

## Overview

### Product Idea

We have implemented a very simple prototype to count remaining products on supermarket shelves.

### Prototype Scope

For prototyping the use case we count soda cans (Coca Cola, Fanta, Sprite) which we place on a book shelf next to our desk.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- You have ANACONDA package manager installed. If not please install it => https://www.anaconda.com/download/

### Installation Procedure

1. open a shell / command line
2. create a new anaconda environment (with Python 3.11) by using the following command: conda create -n your_environment_name
3. active your newly create Anaconda environment by running this command on the shell / cmd line: conda activate your_environment_name
2. download the prototype code from GitHub -> https://github.com/mschiffejku/eng-ai-intensive-systems
3. change the current directory to the location where your downloaed the source code to
3. install python libraries by running the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. (make sure that the python libraries get installed without exceptions)

### Run the Prototype (Django Web Application)

1. open a shell / command line
2. change the current directory to the location where you downloaded the source code to
3. run the following command: python manage.py runserver
4. you should see the follow output on the console:

Django version 5.0.4, using settings 'ais_project.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

### Perform a test drive on the prototype

1. open the web browser of your choice, e.g. Firefox
2. open the following URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/
3. make sure that you see the home page of the prototype
4. click on the START button or the START CAN menu item in the menu bar to upload a picture of a shelf
5. note: enter username = a and password = a if you are being asked to enter your credentials
6. ... please refer to the demo video for details with regards to how to use the prototype application ...
